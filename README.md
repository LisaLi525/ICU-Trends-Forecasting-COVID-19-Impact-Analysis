# ICU Trends Forecasting: COVID-19 Impact Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing ICU trends influenced by COVID-19, using advanced machine learning techniques. It's designed for businesses and healthcare organizations to understand the impact of the pandemic on ICU admissions and prepare accordingly.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Automated functions to clean and process ICU data.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Utilizes ANN and LSTM models to forecast ICU trends.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for various time series datasets beyond COVID-19 ICU data.
- **Visual Analysis**: Includes functionality to visually compare forecasted results with actual data.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Python installed along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- Sklearn
- Tensorflow

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Update the `run_analysis` function with the path to your dataset.
2. **Execute the Script**: Run the `run_analysis` function to process the data and perform forecasting.
3. **Result Interpretation**: Review the output plots for insights into ICU trends.

## Example
```python
run_analysis("path/to/your/icu_data.csv")
```
