# ICU Trends Forecasting: COVID-19 Impact Analysis

## Overview
"ICU Trends Forecasting" is a Python-based analytical project to predict ICU admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using advanced machine learning techniques like ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks), this project helps healthcare organizations and businesses understand and prepare for ICU capacity needs.

## Features
- Automated data processing for ICU datasets.
- Time series forecasting using ANN and LSTM models.
- Scalable design for various time series datasets.
- Visual comparison of forecasted results with actual ICU admission data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, Sklearn, TensorFlow

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install the required Python libraries using the command:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib keras sklearn tensorflow
   ```

## Usage
To run the analysis:
1. Update the `filepath` variable in the `main` function with the path to your ICU data CSV file.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Review the output plots to understand the ICU trends.

Example usage:
```python
run_analysis("path/to/your/icu_data.csv")
```
